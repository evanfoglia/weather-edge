# 🌡️ Kalshi Weather Arbitrage Bot

An automated trading bot that finds **guaranteed arbitrage opportunities** on Kalshi weather prediction markets by exploiting the **monotonic nature of daily maximum temperature**.

## 🎯 What Does This Bot Do?

Kalshi offers prediction markets like: *"Will the high temperature in Chicago be above 85°F today?"*

The key insight: **Daily maximum temperature can only go UP, never down.** Once the high reaches 85°F at 2 PM, it's guaranteed to end at 85°F or higher.

This bot:
1. **Monitors real-time weather data** from NWS and METAR
2. **Compares current max temps to market thresholds**
3. **Identifies guaranteed winning trades** when outcomes are already locked
4. **Executes trades automatically** (live or paper mode)

## 📈 How It Makes Money

### The Strategy

| Market Type | Example | Winning Condition | Our Trade |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Above** | "Above 85°F?" | Temp already ≥ 85°F | BUY YES |
| **Below** | "Below 80°F?" | Temp already > 80°F | BUY NO |
| **Between** | "81-84°F?" | Temp already > 85°F | BUY NO |

### Example Trade

```
Market: "Will Chicago high be above 85°F?"
Current max temp: 87°F  ← Already exceeded!
YES price: 92¢

Since 87°F ≥ 85°F, YES is GUARANTEED to win.
Buy YES at 92¢ → Receive $1.00 at settlement → Profit: 8¢ per contract
```

### Safety Buffers

To avoid edge cases with temperature fluctuations:
- **Above markets**: No buffer (locked once reached)
- **Below markets**: +0.5°F buffer
- **Between markets**: +0.5°F buffer

## 💰 How It Determines Bet Size

The bot uses two limits to size positions:

```python
# From .env:
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=20    # Maximum dollars per trade
MAX_CONTRACT_LIMIT=50   # Maximum contracts per trade
```

### Calculation

```
1. Start with MAX_POSITION_SIZE ($20)
2. Divide by contract price: $20 / $0.45 = 44 contracts
3. Cap at MAX_CONTRACT_LIMIT: min(44, 50) = 44 contracts
4. Final trade: 44 contracts × $0.45 = $19.80
```

### Examples

| Contract Price | Calculation | Contracts | Cost |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|------|
| 1¢ | $20 / $0.01 = 2000 → cap at 50 | 50 | $0.50 |
| 45¢ | $20 / $0.45 = 44 | 44 | $19.80 |
| 92¢ | $20 / $0.92 = 21 | 21 | $19.32 |
