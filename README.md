# 🌡️ Kalshi Weather Arbitrage Bot

An automated trading bot that finds **guaranteed arbitrage opportunities** on Kalshi weather prediction markets by exploiting the **monotonic nature of daily maximum temperature**.

## 🎯 What Does This Bot Do?

Kalshi offers prediction markets like: *"Will the high temperature in Chicago be above 85°F today?"*

The key insight: **Daily maximum temperature can only go UP, never down.** Once the high reaches 85°F at 2 PM, it's guaranteed to end at 85°F or higher.

This bot:
1. **Monitors real-time weather data** from IEM, NWS, and METAR
2. **Tracks daily max temperature** with full-day lookback from midnight
3. **Compares current max temps to market thresholds**
4. **Identifies guaranteed winning trades** when outcomes are already locked
5. **Executes trades automatically** (live or paper mode)

## 📈 How It Makes Money

### The Strategy: "Pure Arbitrage"
The bot is now configured for **pure, risk-free arbitrage**. It does not speculate on future temperature rises. It only trades when the event has **already happened** according to official data.

| Market Type | Example | Winning Condition | Trade Action |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Above** | "Above 85°F?" | Temp ≥ 86.0°F (Threshold + 1.0°) | BUY YES |
| **Below** | "Below 80°F?" | Temp > 81.0°F (Threshold + 1.0°) | BUY NO |
| **Between** | "81-84°F?" | Temp > 85.0°F (High Limit + 1.0°) | BUY NO |

### Safety Buffers
To ensure 100% win rate and avoid "bad beats" from sensor variance or minor data corrections, we apply a **strict +1.0°F safety buffer** to ALL trades.

- If the market is "High > 71°F", the bot waits for **72.0°F** (or higher) before buying YES.
- It will NOT trade at 71.1°F, ensuring we are well clear of the "borderline" risk zone.

## 💰 How It Determines Bet Size

The bot uses two limits to size positions:

```python
# From .env:
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=20    # Maximum dollars per trade
MAX_CONTRACT_LIMIT=50   # Maximum contracts per trade
```

### Calculation

```
1. Start with MAX_POSITION_SIZE ($20)
2. Divide by contract price: $20 / $0.45 = 44 contracts
3. Cap at MAX_CONTRACT_LIMIT: min(44, 50) = 44 contracts
4. Final trade: 44 contracts × $0.45 = $19.80
```

### Examples

| Contract Price | Calculation | Contracts | Cost |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|------|
| 1¢ | $20 / $0.01 = 2000 → cap at 50 | 50 | $0.50 |
| 45¢ | $20 / $0.45 = 44 | 44 | $19.80 |
| 92¢ | $20 / $0.92 = 21 | 21 | $19.32 |

## 📡 Data Sources & Validity

The bot ensures data accuracy by aggregating three independent, official government weather sources.

### 1. The Sources
- **IEM (Iowa Environmental Mesonet)**:
  - **Role**: **System of Record** for Daily Highs.
  - **Capability**: Provides a full 24-hour lookback of ASOS station data.
  - **Why it's critical**: If the daily high (e.g., 90°F) occurred at 2:00 PM, but the current temp is 85°F at 5:00 PM, IEM "remembers" the 90°F high.
- **NWS (National Weather Service)**: 
  - **Role**: Official current temperature check.
  - **Capability**: Latest observation from `api.weather.gov`.
- **METAR (Aviation Weather)**:
  - **Role**: Low-latency current temperature check.
  - **Capability**: Latest observation from aviation feeds.

### 2. Refresh Rate
- The bot polls all three sources every **30 seconds** (default configurable via `POLL_INTERVAL`).
- While source APIs typically update hourly, frequent polling ensures we catch the update immediately when it happens.

### 3. Validity Logic
Since a "Daily High" is a **monotonic** value (it can never go down, only up):
- The bot takes the **MAXIMUM** value reported by any of the three sources.
- **Example**:
  - IEM History: Max 88°F (occurred at 1pm)
  - Current METAR: 82°F (it cooled down)
  - **Bot Decision**: The Daily High is **88°F**.
- This guarantees we never "miss" a winning bet just because the temperature dropped later in the day.
